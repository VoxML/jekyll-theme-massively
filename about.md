What is VoxWorld?

Another paragraph about VoxWorld

### VoxWorld is Important
<div class="box">
  <p>
  A <b>voxicon</> is a lexicon of "visual object concepts" or <b>voxemes</b>. A voxeme is a visual instantiation of a lexical item, used for generating multimodal simulations of motion events in a three-dimensional environment.</p>

<p>VoxWorld is based on the modeling language VoxML, which is used to convert natural language expressions into real time visualizations using real-world semantic knowledge of objects and events. Our approach adds a focus on motion and dynamics to the world of multimodal visual grounding to create an environment for situated natural language understanding.
